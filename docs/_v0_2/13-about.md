A long time ago I started keeping a list of movies and TV series I've watched and would like to watch. Keeping track
of all these movies and series in a Word document because cumbersome since now there are more than a thousand items
(I watch a lot of movies). Thus I've decided to create an app so that the list can be more structured and so that I can
analyze the data somehow. Also, this is a fun side project.

## Project Status

I've been working on this app for more than a year and a half (as of November 2020) and it's not nearly done. I've
released versions 0.1 and 0.2, because now the app is at least usable, although it lacks lots of features yet.
Versions 0.x should be considered pre-release and as such probably shouldn't be used in general since there will be
breaking changes.

I'm actively working on the app, although sometimes a take breaks to work on other projects, so expect more versions
soon.
