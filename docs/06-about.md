# About Movie List

A long time ago I started keeping a list of movies and TV series I've watched and would like to watch. Keeping track
of all these movies and series in a Word document because cumbersome since now there are more than a thousand items
(I watch a lot of movies). Thus I've decided to create an app so that the list can be more structured and so that I can
analyze the data somehow. Also, this is a fun side project.

## Project Status

I've been working on this app for a year and a half (as of July 2020) and it's not nearly done. I'm going to release
version 0.1 soon, because now the app is a least usable, although it lacks lots of features yet. Versions 0.x should
be considered pre-release and as such probably shouldn't be used in general since there will be breaking changes.

I'm currently working on the documentation (these very pages) so expect more of this in the coming days/weeks.
