# Movie List

An app which keeps track of the movies and TV series you have watched or would like to watch.

A long time ago I started keeping a list of movies and TV series I've watched and would like to watch. Keeping track
of all these movies and series in a Word document because cumbersome since now there are more than a thousand entries
(I watch a lot of movies). Thus I've decided to create an app so that the list can be more structured and so that I can
analyze the data somehow. Also, this is a fun side project.

If you want to use this app to track movies and series, you can certainly do so, but bear in mind that this is a
personal project - I'm writing this app for myself, at my own pace, and according to my own needs.

## Docs

The docs for this app are available [here](https://tolikpylypchuk.github.io/MovieList) and contain extensive info on
how to use the app.

## Project Status

I've been working on this app for a year and a half (as of July 2020) and it's not nearly done. I've released version
0.1, because now the app is at least usable, although it lacks lots of features yet. Versions 0.x should be considered
pre-release and as such probably shouldn't be used in general since there will be breaking changes.

I'm actively working on the app, although sometimes a take breaks to work on other projects, so expect more versions
soon.

## Building from Source

If you want to build your own version of this app, you simply need
[.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). That's it, there are no special prerequisites.

Run the `Publish-App` script to create a zipped app which you can then extract to anywhere.

If you also want to build the docs locally, you need [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
